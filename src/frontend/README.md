# React + TypeScript + Vite

Project has been configured with React + TypeScript, bundled using Vite

Getting Started:
```
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

### Notes:
- We're using NPM as our package manager, any new packages will be installed using `npm -i [package_name]`
 - Feel free to install whatever packages make frontend easier, but note that you should be running these commands in the `frontend` dir
- `npm -i` or `npm install` only needs to be run on initial startup or whenever new packages are installed, but it doesn't hurt to always run it
- npm run dev runs/lets you see the frontend, just click the link to open it up in your browser

**The best way to learn react is through the official documentation**
https://react.dev/

* if you see any tutorials using classes, its too old, modern react is functional
