### Project Description:
Our project is a Pokemon Go journal that aims to allow players to keep track of their activities
and interactions with both in-game and outside of game elements. Our database models
different in-game aspects that players may want to keep track of, in addition to actions that
players may do in-game. As such, players can keep track of what they have accomplished within
the game, as well as compare with other players.

Created as part of CPSC 304
